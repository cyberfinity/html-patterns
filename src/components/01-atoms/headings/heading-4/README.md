## Purpose

Level 4 headings (`<h4>`) are used if any sections headed by a level 3 heading need to be further sub-divided.

Note that HTML5 introduced [sectioning elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#sectioning-content-2) and the [outline algorithm](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#outlines), which affords more flexibility to how the 6 heading levels are used. Refer to the [heading 1 notes](heading-1) for information.
