## Purpose

Level 5 headings (`<h5>`) are used if any sections headed by a level 4 heading need to be further sub-divided. Unless you have a very long and complex body of text level 5 headings should be a rare occurrence. Even in that event, it may be worth considering splitting your content across multiple pages rather than making one, massive one.

Note that HTML5 introduced [sectioning elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#sectioning-content-2) and the [outline algorithm](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#outlines), which affords more flexibility to how the 6 heading levels are used. Refer to the [heading 1 notes](heading-1) for information.
