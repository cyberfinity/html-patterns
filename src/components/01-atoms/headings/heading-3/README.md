## Purpose

Level 3 headings, represented by the `<h3>` element, represent the headings of sub-sections page.

Note that HTML5 introduced [sectioning elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#sectioning-content-2) and the [outline algorithm](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#outlines), which affords more flexibility to how the 6 heading levels are used. Refer to the [heading 1 notes](heading-1) for information.
