## Purpose

The `<data>` element represents its contents, along with a machine-readable form of those contents in the `value` attribute.

*The `value` attribute must be present.* Its value must be a representation of the element's contents in a machine-readable format. When the value is date- or time-related, the more specific [`<time>`](time) element can be used instead.
