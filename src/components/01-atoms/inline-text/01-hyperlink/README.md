## Purpose

Hyperlinks (`<a>` - short for "hypertext **anchor**"), create clickable links to other URLs. They are labelled by their content which is usually text.

It is also possible to create a placeholder link by omitting the `href` attribute. These are useful to indicate text that would normally be a clickable link if it had been relevant. A typical use for this is a website's main navigation menu - the item that corresponds to the current page can be represented by a placeholder to avoid the page linking to itself.
