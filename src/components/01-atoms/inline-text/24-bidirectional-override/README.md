## Purpose

The `<bdo>` element represents explicit text directionality formatting control for its children. It allows authors to override the Unicode bidirectional algorithm by explicitly specifying a direction override.

Authors must specify the `dir` attribute on this element, with the value `ltr` to specify a left-to-right override and with the value `rtl` to specify a right-to-left override. The auto value must not be specified.
