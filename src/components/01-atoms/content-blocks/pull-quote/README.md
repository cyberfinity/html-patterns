## Usage

A **pull quote** (also known as a lift-out pull quote) is a key phrase, quotation, or excerpt that has been pulled from an article and used as a graphic element, serving to entice readers into the article or to highlight a key topic. It is typically placed in a larger or distinctive typeface and on the same page. Pull quotes are often used in magazine and newspaper articles, annual reports, and brochures, as well as on the web.

HTML doesn't have a dedicated element for pull quotes, but the specification for the `<aside>` element mentions that it can be used for pull quotes. In order to differentiate this use of `<aside>` from other applications, the `pull-quote` class has been added.
